\title{Map Names to Aesthetic Labels in ggplot2}
\usage{
labs_map(names)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{A named list or vector where names are variable names and values
are the desired labels for those variables in the plot.}
}
\value{
An object of class "labs_map" that can be added to a ggplot object
using the + operator. When added, it will automatically apply appropriate
labels based on the plot's aesthetic mappings.
}
\description{
This function automatically maps variable names to labels based on a plot's
aesthetic mapping. It provides a convenient way to set multiple labels at
once by matching the names provided to aes / used by default in ggplot with
a prespecified list.
}
\details{
This is particularly useful when you have a consistent naming scheme for
variables and want to apply human-readable labels without manually specifying
each aesthetic.
}
\examples{
library(ggplot2)

# Create plot and apply labels
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs_map(c(
    "mpg" = "Miles per Gallon",
    "hp" = "Horsepower",
    "factor(cyl)" = "Number of\nCylinders"
  ))
