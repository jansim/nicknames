The goal of nicknames is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of nicknames from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jansim/nicknames")
```

## Example

With nicknames, you can register the mapping between columns in your data and human readable column names once and easily re-use them everywhere.

```{r ex-setup}
library(nicknames)

nn_register(c(
  "mpg" = "Miles per Gallon",
  "hp" = "Horsepower",
  "factor(cyl)" = "Number of\nCylinders"
))
```

Including ggplot2 plots...

```{r ex-ggplot}
library(ggplot2)

# Create plot and apply nickname labels
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs_nn()
```

...dataframes...

```{r ex-df}
library(dplyr)

mtcars |>
  select(mpg, hp, cyl) |>
  nn() |>
  head()
```

...and column names directly.

```{r ex-char}
nn("mpg")
```
