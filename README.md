The goal of nicknames is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of nicknames from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jansim/nicknames")
```

## Example

With nicknames, you can register the mapping between columns in your
data and human readable column names once and easily re-use them
everywhere.

``` r
library(nicknames)

nn_register(c(
  "mpg" = "Miles per Gallon",
  "hp" = "Horsepower",
  "factor(cyl)" = "Number of\nCylinders"
))
```

Including ggplot2 plots…

``` r
library(ggplot2)

# Create plot and apply nickname labels
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs_nn()
```

…dataframes…

``` r
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

mtcars |>
  select(mpg, hp, cyl) |>
  nn() |>
  head()
#>                   Miles per Gallon Horsepower cyl
#> Mazda RX4                     21.0        110   6
#> Mazda RX4 Wag                 21.0        110   6
#> Datsun 710                    22.8         93   4
#> Hornet 4 Drive                21.4        110   6
#> Hornet Sportabout             18.7        175   8
#> Valiant                       18.1        105   6
```

…and column names directly.

``` r
nn("mpg")
#> [1] "Miles per Gallon"
```
